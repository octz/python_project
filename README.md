# python_project
The code is from a course project where I used the Python scikit-learn module to predict whether a hydrogel recipe will generate hydrogels with large compressive strength (>1MPa) or not (<1MPa). The data was pulled from literature and additional molecular descriptor features for the reagents from PaDEL-descriptor was used in model generation.
